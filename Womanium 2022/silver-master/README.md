## QWorld's Silver 
Welcome to QWorld's Silver!


Silver is QWorld's intermediate level tutorial on quantum computing and programming focusing on complex numbers, QFT and Shor's Algorithm 

## Installation

Follow the instructions given in the [installation file](installation.pdf)!

**Using Binder:** _You may [launch Silver in the cloud with binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/qworld%2Fsilver/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/content.ipynb) but **please be aware of that**_ 
- _each time a new session is created, which takes some time to be initiated, and all changes are lost when ending the session; and,_
- _the session might be terminated if a new tab is not opened within 10 minutes._

## Credits

Most of the <font style="color: #A9A9A9;"><b><i>Silver</i></b></font> is prepared under the project QPool2019 [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/qpool2019) in 2019-2020 and it is expected to have contributions from public as well. 

We would like to thank participants of the QSilver Revision Week organized in January 2021 and the participants of the QSilver Pilot Workshop organized in April 2021 for revising the material.
