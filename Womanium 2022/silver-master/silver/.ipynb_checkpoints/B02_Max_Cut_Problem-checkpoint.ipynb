    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we implement Grover's search algorithm to find 2-coloring of a graph which helps us to determine whether a graph is bipartite or not. When the given graph is bipartite, then solving Max-Cut problem for the given graph becomes trivial. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should note that our algorithm takes $O(\\sqrt{2^n})$ steps, but this problem can be solved classically in $O(n^2)$ steps. On the other hand, we see this application as a pedagogical example of how to design an oracle and then apply Grover’s search algorithm for a well-known problem on graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebooks, we will construct an oracle which solves Max-Cut problem for any arbitrary graph."
